# Rotate 2D Matrix

## Task

Given an n x n 2D matrix, rotate it 90 degrees clockwise.

    Prototype: def rotate_2d_matrix(matrix):
    Do not return anything. The matrix must be edited in-place.
    You can assume the matrix will have 2 dimensions and will not be empty.

## Sample

```
    [[1, 2, 3],        [[1,4,7],         [[7,4,1],  
     [4, 5, 6],     =>  [2,5,8],    =>    [8,5,2], 
     [7, 8, 9]]         [3,6,9]]          [9,6,3]]

```
